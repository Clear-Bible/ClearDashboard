\v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen ones who are living as foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia... 
\v 2 Putting away therefore all wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking, 
\v 3 as newborn babies, long for the pure spiritual milk, that with it you may grow, 
\v 4 One day during that year when it was hot, Yahweh appeared to Abraham again near the big trees that belonged to Mamre, while Abraham was sitting in the entrance to his tent. 
\v 5 Abraham looked up [MTY] and was surprised to see three men standing near him. Actually, one was Yahweh, and the other two were angels. When he saw them, he ran to meet them. He prostrated himself with his face on the ground to show respect, 
\v 6 and said to one of them, “Sir, if you are pleased with me, stay here for a little while [LIT]. 
\v 7 Allow my servants to bring a little water and wash your feet, and rest under this tree. When you are very troubled, you can still have a relationship with God. 
\v 8 How fortunate are those who do not do what the wicked people advise them to do, who do not imitate the behavior of sinful people, and who do not join with people who ridicule God. 
\v 9 Instead, those with whom Yahweh is pleased delight in understanding what he teaches us. They read and think every day and every night about what Yahweh teaches. 
\v 10 They constantly do things that please God, just as fruit trees that have been planted along the banks of a stream produce fruit at the right time every year. Like trees that never wither, they succeed in everything that they do. 
\v 11 The words that the Lord communicated to Joel son of Pethuel. 
\v 12 Yahweh our Lord, how magnificent is your name in all the earth, you who reveal your glory in the heavens above. 
\v 13 Out of the mouth of babies and infants you have established praise because of your enemies, so that you might silence both the enemy and the avenger. 
\v 14 At once the Spirit made him go into the desert, 
\v 15 where he stayed 40 days, being tempted by Satan. Wild animals were there also, but angels came and helped him. 
\v 16 After John had been put in prison, Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News from God. 

\c 2
\v 1 Now the word of the LORD came to Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 
\v 2 “Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and call out against it, for their evil has come up before me.” 
\v 3 But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. 
\v 4 The words that the Lord communicated to Joel son of Pethuel.

\v 0 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba. 
\v 1 Have mercy on me, God, according to your loving kindness. According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. 
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity. Cleanse me from my sin. 
\v 3 For I know my transgressions. My sin is constantly before me. 
\v 4 Against you, and you only, I have sinned, and done that which is evil in your sight, so you may be proved right when you speak, and justified when you judge. 
\v 5 Behold, I was born in iniquity. My mother conceived me in sin. 
\v 6 Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts. You teach me wisdom in the inmost place. 
\v 7 Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean. Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
\v 8 Let me hear joy and gladness, that the bones which you have broken may rejoice. 
\v 9 Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all of my iniquities. 
\v 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God. Renew a right spirit within me. 
\v 11 Don’t throw me from your presence, and don’t take your Holy Spirit from me. 
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation. Uphold me with a willing spirit. 
\v 13 Then I will teach transgressors your ways. Sinners will be converted to you. 
\v 14 Deliver me from the guilt of bloodshed, O God, the God of my salvation. My tongue will sing aloud of your righteousness. 
\v 15 Lord, open my lips. My mouth will declare your praise. 
\v 16 For you don’t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it. You have no pleasure in burnt offering. 
\v 17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. O God, you will not despise a broken and contrite heart. 
\v 18 Do well in your good pleasure to Zion. Build the walls of Jerusalem. 
\v 19 Then you will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, in burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar. 

\c 6
\v 1 But when Joseph heard that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea, he was afraid to go there. He was given more instructions in a dream, so he went to the province of Galilee 
\v 2 and made his home in a town named Nazareth. And so what the prophets had said came true: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
