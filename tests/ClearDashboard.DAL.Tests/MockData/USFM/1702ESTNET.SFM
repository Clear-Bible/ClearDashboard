\v 1
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 1\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft In the English Bible Esther appears adjacent to Ezra-Nehemiah and with the historical books, but in the Hebrew Bible it is one of five short books (the so-called Megillot) that appear toward the end of the biblical writings. The canonicity of the book was questioned by some in ancient Judaism and early Christianity. It is one of five OT books that were at one time regarded as \it antilegomena\it* (i.e., books “spoken against”). The problem with Esther was the absence of any direct mention of God. Some questioned whether a book that did not mention God could be considered sacred scripture. Attempts to resolve this by discovering the tetragrammaton (YHWH) encoded in the Hebrew text (e.g., in the initial letters of four consecutive words in the Hebrew text of \fx Es 5:4\fx*) are unconvincing, although they do illustrate how keenly the problem was felt by some. Martin Luther also questioned the canonicity of this book, objecting to certain parts of its content. Although no copy of Esther was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, this does not necessarily mean that the Qumran community did not regard it as canonical. It is possible that the absence of Esther from what has survived at Qumran is merely a coincidence. Although the book does not directly mention God, it would be difficult to read it without sensing the providence of God working in powerful, though at times subtle, ways to rescue his people from danger and possible extermination. The absence of mention of the name of God may be a deliberate part of the literary strategy of the writer.\f* The following events happened 
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “it came about”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver* “Now it came to pass.”\f* in the days of Ahasuerus. 
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft Where the Hebrew text has “Ahasuerus” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*) in this book the \ver LXX\ver* has “Artaxerxes.” The ruler mentioned in the Hebrew text is Xerxes I (ca. 486-465 \sc B.C.\sc*), and a number of modern English versions use “Xerxes” (e.g., \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver*). \f* (I am referring to 
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 4\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “in the days of Ahasuerus, that Ahasuerus who used to rule…” The phrase “I am referring to” has been supplied to clarify the force of the third person masculine singular pronoun, which is functioning like a demonstrative pronoun.\f* that Ahasuerus who used to rule over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces 
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 5\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft The geographical extent of the Persian empire was vast. The division of Xerxes' empire into 127 smaller provinces was apparently done for purposes of administrative efficiency.\f* extending all the way from India to Ethiopia. 
\f + \fr 1:1 \fn 6\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “Cush” (so \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*; \ver KJV\ver* “Ethiopia”) referring to the region of the upper Nile in Africa. India and Cush (i.e., Ethiopia) are both mentioned in a tablet taken from the foundation of Xerxes' palace in Persepolis that describes the extent of this empire. See \bk ANET\bk* 316-17.\f*
) 
\v 2 In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa 
\f + \fr 1:2 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “Shushan” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver*). Most recent English versions render this as “Susa.”\fp \fl Study Note \fl* The city of \it Susa\it* served as one of several capitals of Persia during this time; the other locations were Ecbatana, Babylon, and Persepolis. Partly due to the extreme heat of its summers, Susa was a place where Persian kings stayed mainly in the winter months. Strabo indicates that reptiles attempting to cross roads at midday died from the extreme heat (\it Geography\it* 15.3.10-11).\f* the citadel, 
\f + \fr 1:2 \fn 8\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft The Hebrew word \heb בִּירָה\heb* (\theb birah\theb*) can refer to a castle or palace or temple. Here it seems to have in mind that fortified part of the city that might be called an acropolis or citadel. Cf. \ver KJV\ver* “palace”; \ver NAB\ver* “stronghold”; \ver NASB\ver* “capital”; \ver NLT\ver* “fortress.”\f* 
\v 3 in the third 
\f + \fr 1:3 \fn 9\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft The third year of Xerxes' reign would be ca. 483 \sc B.C.\sc*\f* year of his reign he provided a banquet for all his officials and his servants. The army 
\f + \fr 1:3 \fn 10\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft Due to the large numbers of people implied, some scholars suggest that the original text may have read “leaders of the army” (cf. \ver NAB\ver* “Persian and Median aristocracy”; \ver NASB\ver* “the army officers”; \ver NIV\ver* “the military leaders”). However, there is no textual evidence for this emendation, and the large numbers are not necessarily improbable.\f* of Persia and Media 
\f + \fr 1:3 \fn 11\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Unlike the Book of Daniel, the usual order for this expression in Esther is “Persia and Media” (cf. vv. 14, 18, 19). In Daniel the order is “Media and Persia,” indicating a time in their history when Media was in the ascendancy.\f* was present, 
\f + \fr 1:3 \fn 12\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft The size of the banquet described here, the number of its invited guests, and the length of its duration, although certainly immense by any standard, are not without precedent in the ancient world. C. A. Moore documents a Persian banquet for 15,000 people and an Assyrian celebration with 69,574 guests (\it Esther\it* [\ver AB\ver*], 6).\f* as well as the nobles and the officials of the provinces. 
\p 
\v 4 He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time 
\f + \fr 1:4 \fn 13\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “many days” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver*); \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “for many days.”\f* – a hundred and eighty days, to be exact! 
\f + \fr 1:4 \fn 14\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft The words “to be exact!” are not in the Hebrew text but have been supplied in the translation to bring out the clarifying nuance of the time period mentioned. Cf. \ver KJV\ver* “even an hundred and fourscore days.”\f* 
\v 5 When those days 
\f + \fr 1:5 \fn 15\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The Hebrew text of Esther does not indicate why this elaborate show of wealth and power was undertaken. According to the \ver LXX\ver* these were “the days of the wedding” (\grk αἱ ἡμέραι τοῦ γάμου\grk*, \tgrk hai hēmerai tou gamou\tgrk*), presumably the king's wedding. However, a number of scholars have called attention to the fact that this celebration takes place just shortly before Xerxes' invasion of Greece. It is possible that the banquet was a rallying for the up-coming military effort. See Herodotus, \it Histories\it* 7.8. There is no reason to adopt the longer reading of the \ver LXX\ver* here.\f* were completed, the king then provided a seven-day 
\f + \fr 1:5 \fn 16\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* has \grk ἕξ\grk* (\tgrk hex\tgrk*, “six”) instead of “seven.” Virtually all English versions follow the reading of the \ver MT\ver* here, “seven.”\f* banquet for all the people who were present 
\f + \fr 1:5 \fn 17\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “were found.”\f* in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly. 
\f + \fr 1:5 \fn 18\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “from the great and unto the small.”\f* It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace. 
\v 6 The furnishings included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen 
\f + \fr 1:6 \fn 19\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft The\it finest linen\it* was byssus, a fine, costly, white fabric made in Egypt, Palestine, and Edom, and imported into Persia (\ver BDB\ver* 101 s.v. \heb בּוּץ\heb*; \bk HALOT\bk* 115-16 s.v. \heb בּוּץ\heb*).\f* and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches 
\f + \fr 1:6 \fn 20\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft The Hebrew noun \heb מִטָּה\heb* (\it mittah\it*) refers to a reclining couch (cf. \ver KJV\ver* “beds”) spread with covers, cloth and pillow for feasting and carousing (\fx Eze 23:41\fx*; \fx Am 3:12\fx*; \fx Am 6:4\fx*; \fx Es 1:6\fx*; \fx Es 7:8\fx*). See \ver BDB\ver* 641-42 s.v.; \bk HALOT\bk* 573 s.v.\f* displayed on a floor made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone. 
\v 7 Drinks 
\f + \fr 1:7 \fn 21\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “to cause to drink” (Hiphil infinitive construct of \heb שָׁקָה\heb*, \it shaqah\it*). As the etymology of the Hebrew word for “banquet” (\heb מִשְׁתֶּה\heb*, \it mishteh\it*, from \heb שָׁתָה\heb*, \it shatah\it*, “to drink”) hints, drinking was a prominent feature of ancient Near Eastern banquets.\f* were served in golden containers, all of which differed from one another. Royal wine was available in abundance at the king's expense. 
\v 8 There were no restrictions on the drinking, 
\f + \fr 1:8 \fn 22\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “the drinking was according to law; there was no one compelling.”\f* for the king had instructed all of his supervisors 
\f + \fr 1:8 \fn 23\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “every chief of his house”; \ver KJV\ver* “all the officers of his house”; \ver NLT\ver* “his staff.”\f* that they should do as everyone so desired. 
\f + \fr 1:8 \fn 24\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “according to the desire of man and man.”\f* 
\v 9 Queen Vashti 
\f + \fr 1:9 \fn 25\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Vashti\it* is the name of Xerxes' queen according to the Book of Esther. But in the Greek histories of this period the queen's name is given as Amestris (e.g., Herodotus, \it Histories\it* 9.108-13). The name Vashti does not seem to occur in the nonbiblical records from this period. Apparently the two women are not to be confused, but not enough is known about this period to reconcile completely the biblical and extrabiblical accounts.\f* also gave a banquet for the women in King Ahasuerus' royal palace. 
\s Queen Vashti is Removed from Her Royal Position
\p 
\v 10 On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine, 
\f + \fr 1:10 \fn 26\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “as the heart of the king was good with the wine.” Here the proper name (King Ahasuerus) has been substituted for the title in the translation for stylistic reasons.\f* he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him, 
\f + \fr 1:10 \fn 27\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “King Ahasuerus”; here the proper name has been replaced by the pronoun “him” in the translation for stylistic reasons. Cf. similarly \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “King Xerxes.”\f* 
\v 11 to bring Queen Vashti into the king's presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive. 
\f + \fr 1:11 \fn 28\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “was good of appearance”; \ver KJV\ver* “was fair to look on”; \ver NAB\ver* “was lovely to behold.”\f* 
\v 12 But Queen Vashti refused 
\f + \fr 1:12 \fn 29\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Refusal to obey the king was risky even for a queen in the ancient world. It is not clear why Vashti behaved so rashly and put herself in such danger. Apparently she anticipated humiliation of some kind and was unwilling to subject herself to it, in spite of the obvious dangers. There is no justification in the biblical text for an ancient Jewish targumic tradition that the king told her to appear before his guests dressed in \it nothing but\it* her royal high turban, that is, essentially naked.\f* to come at the king's bidding 
\f + \fr 1:12 \fn 30\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “at the word of the king”; \ver NASB\ver* “at the king's command.”\f* conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed 
\f + \fr 1:12 \fn 31\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “burned in him” (so \ver KJV\ver*).\f* him. 
\p 
\v 13 The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times – for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities. 
\f + \fr 1:13 \fn 32\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “judgment” (so \ver KJV\ver*); \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver* “justice”; \ver NRSV\ver* “custom.”\f* 
\v 14 Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis 
\f + \fr 1:14 \fn 33\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “seers of the face of the king”; \ver NASB\ver* “who had access to the king's presence.”\f* and had the most prominent offices 
\f + \fr 1:14 \fn 34\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “were sitting first”; \ver NAB\ver* “held first rank in the realm.”\f* in the kingdom. 
\v 15 The king asked, 
\f + \fr 1:15 \fn 35\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft These words are not present in the Hebrew text, but have been supplied in the translation for clarity (cf. \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver*, all of which supply similar phrases).\f* “By law, 
\f + \fr 1:15 \fn 36\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The location of the prepositional phrase “according to law” is somewhat unusual in the Hebrew text, but not so much so as to require emendation. Some scholars suggest deleting the phrase as an instance of dittography from the final part of the immediately preceding word in v. 14. Others suggest taking the phrase with the end of v. 14 rather than with v. 15. Both proposals, however, lack adequate justification.\f* what should be done to Queen Vashti in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?” 
\p 
\v 16 Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, “The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
\v 17 For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, ‘When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.’ 
\v 18 And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger! 
\v 19 If the king is so inclined, 
\f + \fr 1:19 \fn 37\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “If upon the king it is good”; \ver KJV\ver* “If it please the king.” Deferential language was common in ancient Near Eastern court language addressing a despot; it occurs often in Esther.\f* let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed, 
\f + \fr 1:19 \fn 38\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Laws…that cannot be repealed\it*. On the permanence of the laws of Media and Persia see also \fx Es 8:8\fx* and \fx Da 6:8\fx*, \fx Da 6:12\fx*, \fx Da 6:15\fx*.\f* that Vashti 
\f + \fr 1:19 \fn 39\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Previously in this chapter the word “queen” accompanies Vashti's name (cf. vv. 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17). But here, in anticipation of her demotion, the title is dropped.\f* may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another 
\f + \fr 1:19 \fn 40\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “her neighbor”; \ver NIV\ver* “someone else.”\f* who is more deserving than she. 
\f + \fr 1:19 \fn 41\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “who is better than she.” The reference is apparently to worthiness of the royal position as demonstrated by compliance with the king's wishes, although the word \heb טוֹב\heb* (\theb tob\theb*, “good”) can also be used of physical beauty. Cf. \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “more worthy than she.”\f* 
\v 20 And let the king's decision which he will enact be disseminated 
\f + \fr 1:20 \fn 42\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “heard”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “published”; \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “proclaimed.”\f* throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is. 
\f + \fr 1:20 \fn 43\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The phrase “vast though it is” is not included in the \ver LXX\ver*, although it is retained by almost all English versions.\f* Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly.” 
\p 
\v 21 The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan. 
\v 22 He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language, 
\f + \fr 1:22 \fn 44\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft For purposes of diplomacy and governmental communication throughout the far-flung regions of the Persian empire the Aramaic language was normally used. Educated people throughout the kingdom could be expected to have competence in this language. But in the situation described in v. 22 a variety of local languages are to be used, and not just Aramaic, so as to make the king's edict understandable to the largest possible number of people.\f* that every man should be ruling his family 
\f + \fr 1:22 \fn 45\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “in his house”; \ver NIV\ver* “over his own household.”\f* and should be speaking the language of his own people. 
\f + \fr 1:22 \fn 46\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The final prepositional phrase is not included in the \ver LXX\ver*, and this shorter reading is followed by a number of English versions (e.g., \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver*). Some scholars suggest the phrase may be the result of dittography from the earlier phrase “to each people according to its language,” but this is not a necessary conclusion. The edict was apparently intended to reassert male prerogative with regard to two things (and not just one): sovereign and unquestioned leadership within the family unit, and the right of deciding which language was to be used in the home when a bilingual situation existed.\f*

\s Esther Becomes Queen in Vashti's Place
\p 
\v 1 When these things had been accomplished 
\f + \fr 2:1 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “after these things” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*). The expression is very vague from a temporal standpoint, not indicating precisely just how much time might have elapsed. Cf. v. 21.\f* and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered 
\f + \fr 2:1 \fn 2\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft There may be a tinge of regret expressed in the king's remembrance of Vashti. There is perhaps a hint that he wished for her presence once again, although that was not feasible from a practical standpoint. The suggestions by the king's attendants concerning a replacement seem to be an effort to overcome this nostalgia. Certainly it was to their advantage to seek the betterment of the king's outlook. Those around him the most were probably the most likely to suffer the effects of his ire.\f* Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided 
\f + \fr 2:1 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft Or “decreed” (so \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*); \ver TEV\ver* “and about his proclamation against her.”\f* against her. 
\v 2 The king's servants who attended him said, “Let a search be conducted in the king's behalf for attractive young women. 
\f + \fr 2:2 \fn 4\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “young women, virgins, good of form.” The same phrase also occurs in v. 3.\f* 
\v 3 And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem 
\f + \fr 2:3 \fn 5\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “the house of the women” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver*). So also in vv. 9, 11, 13, and \fx Es 2:14\fx*.\f* under the authority of Hegai, the king's eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire.

\f + \fr 2:4 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “who is good in the eyes of the king.”\f* become queen in place of Vashti.” This seemed like a good idea to the king,

\f + \fr 2:5 \fn 9\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Mordecai\it* is a pagan name that reflects the name of the Babylonian deity Marduk. Probably many Jews of the period had two names, one for secular use and the other for use especially within the Jewish community. Mordecai's Jewish name is not recorded in the biblical text.\f* He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,

\f + \fr 2:7 \fn 12\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft According to \bk HALOT\bk* 64 s.v. II \heb אמן\heb* the term \heb אֹמֵן\heb* (\theb ’omen\theb*) means: (1) “attendant” of children (\fx Nu 11:12\fx*; \fx Is 49:23\fx*); (2) “guardian” (\fx 2Ki 10:1\fx*, \fx 2Ki 10:5\fx*; \fx Es 2:7\fx*); (3) “nurse-maid” (\fx 2Sa 4:4\fx*; \fx Ru 4:16\fx*); and (4) “to look after” (\fx Is 60:4\fx*; \fx La 4:5\fx*). Older lexicons did not distinguish this root from the homonym I \heb אָמַן\heb* (\theb ’aman\theb*, “to support; to confirm”; cf. \ver BDB\ver* 52 s.v. \heb אָמַן\heb*). This is reflected in a number of translations by use of a phrase like “brought up” (\ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver*, \ver RSV\ver*, \ver NIV\ver*) or “bringing up” (\ver NASB\ver*).\f* of Hadassah 
\f + \fr 2:7 \fn 13\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Hadassah\it* is a Jewish name that probably means “myrtle”; the name \it Esther\it* probably derives from the Persian word for “star,” although some scholars derive it from the name of the Babylonian goddess Ishtar. Esther is not the only biblical character for whom two different names were used. Daniel (renamed Belteshazzar) and his three friends Hananiah (renamed Shadrach), Mishael (renamed Meshach), and Azariah (renamed Abednego) were also given different names by their captors.\f* (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive.

\v 13 the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace. 
\v 14 In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part 
\f + \fr 2:14 \fn 26\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “second.” The numerical adjective \heb שֵׁנִי\heb* (\it sheniy\it*, “second”) is difficult here. As a modifier for “house” in v. 14 the word would presumably refer to a second part of the harem, one which was under the supervision of a separate official. But in this case the definite article would be expected before “second” (cf. \ver LXX\ver* \grk τὸν δεύτερον\grk*, \tgrk ton deuteron\tgrk*). Some scholars emend the text to \heb שֵׁנִית\heb* (\it shenit\it*, “a second time”), but this does not completely resolve the difficulty since the meaning remains unclear.

\s Mordecai Learns of a Plot against the King
\p 
\v 19 Now when the young women were being gathered again, 
\f + \fr 2:19 \fn 35\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* does not include the words “Now when the young women were being gathered again.” The Hebrew word \heb שֵׁנִית\heb* (\it shenit\it*, “a second time”) is difficult in v. 19, but apparently it refers to a subsequent regathering of the women to the harem.\f* Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate. 
\f + \fr 2:19 \fn 36\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft That Mordecai \it was sitting at the king's gate\it* apparently means that he was a high-ranking government official. It was at the city gate where important business was transacted. Being in this position afforded Mordecai an opportunity to become aware of the plot against the king's life, although the author does not include the particular details of how this information first came to Mordecai's attention.\f* 
\v 20 Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people, 
\f + \fr 2:20 \fn 37\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft That Esther was able so effectively to conceal her Jewish heritage suggests that she was not consistently observing Jewish dietary and religious requirements. As C. A. Moore observes, “In order for Esther to have concealed her ethnic and religious identity…in the harem, she must have eaten…, dressed, and lived like a Persian rather than an observant Jewess” (\it Esther\it* [\ver AB\ver*], 28.) In this regard her public behavior stands in contrast to that of Daniel, for example.\f* just as Mordecai had instructed her. 
\f + \fr 2:20 \fn 38\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* adds the words “to fear God.”\f* Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.

\v 22 When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy, 
\f + \fr 2:22 \fn 43\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft The text of Esther does not disclose exactly how Mordecai learned about the plot against the king's life. Ancient Jewish traditions state that Mordecai overheard conspiratorial conversation, or that an informant brought this information to him, or that it came to him as a result of divine prompting. These conjectures are all without adequate support from the biblical text. The author simply does not tell the source of Mordecai's insight into this momentous event.\f* he informed Queen Esther, 
\f + \fr 2:22 \fn 44\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* simply reads “Esther” and does not include “the queen.”\f* and Esther told the king in Mordecai's behalf.

\f + \fr 3:1 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “made great”; \ver NAB\ver* “raised…to high rank”; \ver NIV\ver* “honored.” \fp \fl Study Note \fl* The promotion of Haman in \fx Es 3:1\fx* for reasons unexplained contrasts noticeably with \fx Es 2:19-23\fx*, where Mordecai's contribution to saving the king's life goes unnoticed. The irony is striking.\f* Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position 
\f + \fr 3:1 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “chair”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “seat”; \ver NASB\ver* “established his authority.”\f* above that of all the officials who were with him.

Other modern English versions leave the conjunction untranslated here (\ver NAB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver*).\f* all the king's servants who were at the king's gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow, 
\f + \fr 3:2 \fn 5\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft \it Mordecai did not bow\it*. The reason for Mordecai's refusal to bow before Haman is not clearly stated here. Certainly the Jews did not refuse to bow as a matter of principle, as though such an action somehow violated the second command of the Decalogue. Many biblical texts bear witness to their practice of falling prostrate before people of power and influence (e.g., \fx 1Sa 24:8\fx*; \fx 2Sa 14:4\fx*; \fx 1Ki 1:16\fx*). Perhaps the issue here was that Haman was a descendant of the Amalekites, a people who had attacked Israel in an earlier age (see \fx Ex 17:8-16\fx*; \fx 1Sa 15:17-20\fx*; \fx De 25:17-19\fx*).\f* nor did he pay him homage. 
\p 
\v 3 Then the servants of the king who were at the king's gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king's commandment?” 
\v 4 And after they had spoken to him day after day 
\f + \fr 3:4 \fn 6\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Mordecai's position in the service of the king brought him into regular contact with these royal officials. Because of this association the officials would have found ample opportunity to complain of Mordecai's refusal to honor Haman by bowing down before him.\f* without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai's part would be permitted. 
\f + \fr 3:4 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “Will the matters of Mordecai stand?”; \ver NASB\ver* “to see whether Mordecai's reason would stand.”\f* Furthermore, he had disclosed to them that he was a Jew. 
\f + \fr 3:4 \fn 8\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft This disclosure of Jewish identity is a reversal of the practice mentioned in \fx Es 1:10\fx*, \fx Es 1:20\fx*.\f*
\p 
\v 5 When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he 
\f + \fr 3:5 \fn 9\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “Haman.” The pronoun (“he”) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons.

\v 6 But the thought of striking out against

\f + \fr 3:6 \fn 12\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The entire first half of the verse is not included in the \ver LXX\ver*.\f* So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai) 
\f + \fr 3:6 \fn 13\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft This parenthetical phrase is not included in the \ver LXX\ver*. Some scholars emend the \ver MT\ver* reading \heb עַם\heb* (\theb ‘am\theb*, “people”) to \heb עִם\heb* (\theb ‘im\theb*, “with”), arguing that the phrase is awkwardly placed and syntactically inappropriate.

\f + \fr 3:7 \fn 15\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft The term \heb פּוּר\heb* (\theb pur\theb*, “lot”) is an Akkadian loanword; the narrator therefore explains it for his Hebrew readers (“that is, the lot”). It is from the plural form of this word (i.e., \it Purim\it*) that the festival celebrating the deliverance of the Jews takes its name (cf. \fx Es 9:24\fx*, \fx Es 9:26\fx*, \fx Es 9:28\fx*, \fx Es 9:31\fx*).\f* (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month.

\f + \fr 3:7 \fn 17\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft Since v. 7 seems to interrupt the flow of the narrative, many scholars have suggested that it is a late addition to the text. But there is not enough evidence to warrant such a conclusion. Even though its placement is somewhat awkward, the verse supplies to the reader an important piece of chronological information.\f*
\p 
\v 8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a particular people 
\f + \fr 3:8 \fn 18\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “one people.” Note the subtle absence at this point of a specific mention of the Jewish people by name.\f* that is dispersed and spread among the inhabitants

In other words Haman is offering the king a bribe equal to two-thirds of the royal income. Doubtless this huge sum of money was to come (in large measure) from the anticipated confiscation of Jewish property and assets once the Jews had been destroyed.

\f + \fr 3:10 \fn 24\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Possessing the king's \it signet ring\it* would enable Haman to act with full royal authority.

As elsewhere in the book of Esther, the writer seems deliberately to keep religious actions in the background.\f* Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic 
\f + \fr 4:3 \fn 6\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “were spread to many”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NIV\ver* “many (+ people \ver NLT\ver*) lay in sackcloth and ashes.”\f* of many. 
\v 4 When Esther's female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai's behavior, 
\f + \fr 4:4 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft The words “about Mordecai's behavior” are not in the Hebrew text, but are supplied in translation for the sake of clarity. Cf. \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “about Mordecai”; \ver TEV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver* “what Mordecai was doing.”\f* the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them. 
\v 5 So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been placed at her service, 
\f + \fr 4:5 \fn 8\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “whom he caused to stand before her”; \ver NASB\ver* “whom the king had appointed to attend her.”\f* and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai's behavior. 
\f + \fr 4:5 \fn 9\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “concerning Mordecai, to know what this was, and why this was.”\f* 
\v 6 So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king's gate. 
\v 7 Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king's treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed. 
\v 8 He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated 
\f + \fr 4:8 \fn 10\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “given” (so \ver KJV\ver*); \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver TEV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “issued”; \ver NIV\ver* “published”; \ver NAB\ver* “promulgated.”\f* in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him on behalf of her people. 
\v 9 So Hathach returned and related Mordecai's instructions 
\f + \fr 4:9 \fn 11\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “the words of Mordecai” (so \ver KJV\ver*); \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver* “what Mordecai had said”; \ver NLT\ver* “with Mordecai's message.”\f* to Esther. 
\p 
\v 10 Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai: 
\v 11 “All the servants of the king and the people of the king's provinces know that there is only one law applicable 
\f + \fr 4:11 \fn 12\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “one is his law”; \ver NASB\ver* “he (the king \ver NIV\ver*) has but one law”\f* to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court – that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared. 
\f + \fr 4:11 \fn 13\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “and he will live”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver* “that he may live”; \ver NIV\ver* “and spare his life.”\f* Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!” 
\p 
\v 12 When Esther's reply

\v 13 he 
\f + \fr 4:13 \fn 15\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “Mordecai.” The pronoun (“he”) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons. A repetition of the proper name here is redundant in terms of contemporary English style.\f* said to take back this answer to Esther: 
\v 14 “Don't imagine that because you are part of the king's household you will be the one Jew 
\f + \fr 4:14 \fn 16\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “from all the Jews”; \ver KJV\ver* “more than all the Jews”; \ver NIV\ver* “you alone of all the Jews.”\f* who will escape. If you keep quiet at this time, liberation and protection for the Jews will appear

D. J. A. Clines disagrees; in his view a contrast between deliverance by Esther and deliverance by God is inappropriate (\it Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther\it* [NCBC], 302). But Clines' suggestion that perhaps the reference is to deliverance by Jewish officials or by armed Jewish revolt is less attractive than seeing this veiled reference as part of the literary strategy of the book, which deliberately keeps God's providential dealings entirely in the background.\f* while you and your father's household perish. It may very well be 
\f + \fr 4:14 \fn 19\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “And who knows whether” (so \ver NASB\ver*). The question is one of hope, but free of presumption. Cf. \fx Jon 3:9\fx*.\f* that you have achieved royal status

\p 
\v 15 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
\v 16 “Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don't eat and don't drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I 
\f + \fr 4:16 \fn 21\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “I and my female attendants.” The translation reverses the order for stylistic reasons.\f* will also fast in the same way. Afterward I will go to the king, even though it violates the law. 
\f + \fr 4:16 \fn 22\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “which is not according to the law” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NAB\ver* “contrary to the law.”\f* If I perish, I perish!” 
\p 
\v 17 So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him. 
\c 5
\s Esther Appeals to the King for Help
\p
\v 1 It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, \f + \fr 5:1 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “of the house of the king”; \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “of the king's palace.”\f* opposite the king's quarters. \f + \fr 5:1 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “the house of the king”; \ver NASB\ver* “the king's rooms”; \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “the king's hall.” This expression is used twice in this verse. In the first instance, it is apparently the larger palace complex that is in view, whereas in the second instance the expression seems to refer specifically to the quarters from which the king governed.\f* The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. \f + \fr 5:1 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “the entrance of the house” (so \ver ASV\ver*).\f*
\v 2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. \f + \fr 5:2 \fn 4\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “she obtained grace in his eyes”; \ver NASB\ver* “she obtained favor in his sight”; \ver NIV\ver* “he was pleased with her”; \ver NLT\ver* “he welcomed her.”\f* The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.
\p
\v 3 The king said to her, “What is on your mind, \f + \fr 5:3 \fn 5\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “What to you?”; \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver* \ver NRSV\ver* “What is it, Queen Esther?”\f* Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!”
\p
\v 4 Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, \f + \fr 5:4 \fn 6\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “If upon the king it is good”; \ver NASB\ver* “If it please the king.”\f* let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.”
\v 5 The king replied, “Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.”
\p So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
\v 6 While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom, \f + \fr 5:6 \fn 7\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \it As much as half the kingdom\it*. Such a statement would no doubt have been understood for the exaggeration that it clearly was. Cf. the similar NT scene recorded in \fx Mk 6:23\fx*, where Herod makes a similar promise to the daughter of Herodias. In that case the request was for the head of John the Baptist, which is a lot less than half the kingdom.\f* and it shall be done!”
\p
\v 7 Esther responded, \f + \fr 5:7 \fn 8\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “answered and said.” This is somewhat redundant in contemporary English and has been simplified in the translation.\f* “My request and my petition is this:
\v 8 If I have found favor in the king's sight and if the king is inclined \f + \fr 5:8 \fn 9\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “if upon the king it is good.” Cf. the similar expression in v. 4, which also occurs in \fx Es 7:3\fx*; \fx Es 8:5\fx*; \fx Es 9:13\fx*.\f* to grant my request and perform my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them. At that time \f + \fr 5:8 \fn 10\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “and tomorrow” (so \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “and then.”\f* I will do as the king wishes.” \f + \fr 5:8 \fn 11\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “I will do according to the word of the king,” i.e., answer the question that he has posed. Cf. \ver NCV\ver* “Then I will answer your question about what I want.”\f*
\s Haman Expresses His Hatred of Mordecai
\p
\v 9 Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged. \f + \fr 5:9 \fn 12\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “happy and good of heart”; \ver NASB\ver* “glad and pleased of heart”; \ver NIV\ver* “happy and in high spirits.”\f* But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king's gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence, \f + \fr 5:9 \fn 13\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “tremble from before him”; \ver NIV\ver* “nor showed fear in his presence”; \ver TEV\ver* “or show any sign of respect as he passed.”\f* Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai.
\v 10 But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.
\p He then sent for his friends to join him, \f + \fr 5:10 \fn 14\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “sent and brought.” The expression is probably a hendiadys (a figure of speech in which a single idea is expressed through two words or phrases), in which case the two verbs could be translated simply as “summoned” (so \ver NAB\ver*) or “sent for” (\ver NASB\ver*).\f* along with his wife Zeresh.
\v 11 Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth, \f + \fr 5:11 \fn 15\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “the glory of his riches” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NRSV\ver* “the splendor of his riches.”\f* his many sons, \f + \fr 5:11 \fn 16\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft According to \fx Es 9:10\fx* Haman had ten sons.\f* and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king's other officials and servants.
\v 12 Haman said, “Furthermore, Queen Esther invited \f + \fr 5:12 \fn 17\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “caused to come”; \ver KJV\ver* “did let no man come in…but myself.”\f* only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited \f + \fr 5:12 \fn 18\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “called to her”; \ver KJV\ver* “invited unto her”; \ver NAB\ver* “I am to be her guest.”\f* along with the king.
\v 13 Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate.”
\p
\v 14 Haman's \f + \fr 5:14 \fn 19\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “his”; the referent (Haman) has been specified in the translation for clarity.\f* wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows seventy-five feet \f + \fr 5:14 \fn 20\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “fifty cubits.” Assuming a standard length for the cubit of about 18 inches (45 cm), this would be about seventy-five feet (22.5 meters), which is a surprisingly tall height for the gallows. Perhaps the number assumes the gallows was built on a large supporting platform or a natural hill for visual effect, in which case the structure itself may have been considerably smaller. Cf. \ver NCV\ver* “a seventy-five foot platform”; \ver CEV\ver* “a tower built about seventy-five feet high.”\f* high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet contented.” \f + \fr 5:14 \fn 21\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft Or “joyful”; \ver NRSV\ver* “in good spirits”; \ver TEV\ver* “happy.”\f*
\p It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.
\c 6
\s The Turning Point: The King Honors Mordecai
\p 
\v 1 Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep, 
\f + \fr 6:1 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “and the sleep of the king fled.” In place of the rather innocuous comment of the Hebrew text, the \ver LXX\ver* reads here, “And the Lord removed the sleep from the king.” The Greek text thus understands the statement in a more overtly theological way than does the Hebrew text, although even in the Hebrew text there may be a hint of God's providence at work in this matter. After all, this event is crucial to the later reversal of Haman's plot to destroy the Jewish people, and a sympathetic reader is likely to look beyond the apparent coincidence.\f* so he asked for the book containing the historical records 
\f + \fr 6:1 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “the book of the remembrances of the accounts of the days”; \ver NAB\ver* “the chronicle of notable events.”\f* to be brought. As the records 
\f + \fr 6:1 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “they”; the referent (the records) has been specified in the translation for clarity.\f* were being read in the king's presence, 
\v 2 it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana 
\f + \fr 6:2 \fn 4\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft This individual is referred to as “Bigthan,” a variant spelling of the name, in \fx Es 2:21\fx*.\f* and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate 
\f + \fr 6:2 \fn 5\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “to send a hand against”; \ver NASB\ver* “had sought to lay hands on.”\f* King Ahasuerus. 
\p 
\v 3 The king asked, “What great honor 
\f + \fr 6:3 \fn 6\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “honor and greatness.” The expression is a hendiadys (see the note on \fx Es 5:10\fx* for an explanation of this figure).\f* was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?” The king's attendants who served him responded, “Not a thing was done for him.” 
\p 
\v 4 Then the king said, “Who is that in the courtyard?” Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him. 
\v 5 The king's attendants said to him, “It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.” The king said, “Let him enter.” 
\p 
\v 6 So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman thought to himself, 
\f + \fr 6:6 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “said in his heart” (so \ver ASV\ver*); \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “said to himself.”\f* “Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?” 
\v 7 So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor, 
\v 8 let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden – one bearing the royal insignia! 
\f + \fr 6:8 \fn 8\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The final comment (“one on whose head the royal crown has been”) is not included in the \ver LXX\ver*.\fp \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “a royal crown on his head.” The reference is to an official decoration or headdress for horses in royal service. See \bk HALOT\bk* 506 s.v. \heb כֶּתֶר\heb*; \it DCH\it* 4:477 s.v. \heb כֶּתֶר\heb*. Cf. \ver TEV\ver* “a royal ornament”; \ver CEV\ver* “a fancy headdress.”\f* 
\v 9 Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king's noble officials. Let him 
\f + \fr 6:9 \fn 9\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The present translation reads with the \ver LXX\ver* \heb וְהִלְבִּישׁוֹ\heb* (\theb v \es e\es*\theb hilbisho\theb*, “and he will clothe him”) rather than the reading of the \ver MT\ver* \heb וְהִלְבִּישׁוּ\heb* (\theb v \es e\es*\theb hilbishu\theb*, “and they will clothe”). The reading of the \ver LXX\ver* is also followed by \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver TEV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver*, and \ver NLT\ver*. Likewise, the later verbs in this verse (“cause him to ride” and “call”) are better taken as singulars rather than plurals.\f* then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling 
\f + \fr 6:9 \fn 10\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “and let them call” (see the previous note).\f* before him, ‘So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!’” 
\p 
\v 10 The king then said to Haman, “Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Don't neglect 
\f + \fr 6:10 \fn 11\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “do not let fall”; \ver NASB\ver* “do not fall short.”\f* a single thing of all that you have said.” 
\p 
\v 11 So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, “So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!” 
\p 
\v 12 Then Mordecai again sat at the king's gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head. 
\v 13 Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men, 
\f + \fr 6:13 \fn 12\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft Part of the Greek tradition and the Syriac \ver Peshitta\ver* understand this word as “friends,” probably reading the Hebrew term \heb רֲכָמָיו\heb* (\it rakhamayv\it*, “his friends”) rather than the reading of the \ver MT\ver* \heb חֲכָמָיו\heb* (\it hakhamayv\it*, “his wise men”). Cf. \ver NLT\ver* “all his friends”; the two readings appear to be conflated by \ver TEV\ver* as “those wise friends of his.”\f* along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, “If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, 
\f + \fr 6:13 \fn 13\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “from the seed of the Jews”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver* similar.\f* you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!” 
\p 
\v 14 While they were still speaking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
\c 7
\s The King Has Haman Executed
\p 
\v 1 So the king and Haman came to dine 
\f + \fr 7:1 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “to drink”; \ver NASB\ver* “to drink wine.” The expression is a metaphor for lavish feasting, cf. \ver NRSV\ver* “to feast”; \ver KJV\ver* “to banquet.”\f* with Queen Esther. 
\v 2 On the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!” 
\p 
\v 3 Queen Esther replied, “If I have met with your approval, 
\f + \fr 7:3 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “If I have found grace in your eyes” (so also in \fx Es 8:5\fx*); \ver TEV\ver* “If it please Your Majesty.”\f* O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition. 
\v 4 For we have been sold

\p 
\v 5 Then King Ahasuerus responded 
\f + \fr 7:5 \fn 4\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The second occurrence of the Hebrew verb \heb וַיּאמֶר\heb* (\theb vayyo’mer\theb*, “and he said”) in the \ver MT\ver* should probably be disregarded.

Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough 
\f + \fr 7:5 \fn 5\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “has so filled his heart”; \ver NAB\ver* “who has dared to do this.”\f* to act in this way?” 
\p 
\v 6 Esther replied, “The oppressor and enemy is this evil Haman!” 
\p Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen. 
\v 7 In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life, 
\f + \fr 7:7 \fn 6\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft There is great irony here in that the man who set out to destroy all the Jews now finds himself begging for his own life from a Jew.\f* for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him. 
\f + \fr 7:7 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “for he saw that calamity was determined for him from the king”; \ver NAB\ver* “the king had decided on his doom”; \ver NRSV\ver* “the king had determined to destroy him.”\f*
\p 
\v 8 When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down 
\f + \fr 7:8 \fn 8\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “falling”; \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver* “had (+ just \ver TEV\ver*) thrown himself (+ down \ver TEV\ver*).”\f* on the couch where Esther was lying. 
\f + \fr 7:8 \fn 9\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “where Esther was” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*). The term “lying” has been supplied in the translation for stylistic reasons; cf. \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “was reclining.”\f* The king exclaimed, “Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!” 
\p As these words left the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face. 
\v 9 Harbona,

\p The king said, “Hang him on it!” 
\v 10 So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king's rage then abated.

\v 2 The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman's estate.
\p
\v 3 Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet.

\v 4 When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she \f + \fr 8:4 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “Esther.” The pronoun (“she”) was used in the translation for stylistic reasons. A repetition of the proper name is redundant here in terms of contemporary English style.\f* arose and stood before the king.
\p
\v 5 She said, “If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, \f + \fr 8:5 \fn 4\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* does not include the expression “the Agagite.”\f* which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king's provinces.

\p
\v 7 King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have already given Haman's estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action \f + \fr 8:7 \fn 6\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “sent forth his hand”; \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver* “attacked”; \ver NLT\ver* “tried to destroy.” Cf. \fx Es 9:2\fx*.\f* against the Jews.
\v 8 Now you write in the king's name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king's signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be rescinded.”
\p
\v 9 The king's scribes were quickly \f + \fr 8:9 \fn 7\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “in that time”; \ver NIV\ver* “At once.”\f* summoned – in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. \f + \fr 8:9 \fn 8\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft Cf. \fx Es 3:12\fx*.

\v 10 Mordecai \f + \fr 8:10 \fn 11\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “He”; the referent (Mordecai) has been specified in the translation for clarity.\f* wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.
\p
\v 11 The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves – to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their women and children, \f + \fr 8:11 \fn 12\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “children and women.” As in \fx Es 3:13\fx*, the translation follows contemporary English idiom, which reverses the order.\f* and to confiscate their property.
\v 12 This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus – namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).
\v 13 A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that \f + \fr 8:13 \fn 13\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “this” (so \ver NASB\ver*); most English versions read “that” here for stylistic reasons.\f* day to avenge themselves from their enemies.
\p
\v 14 The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king's edict without delay. \f + \fr 8:14 \fn 14\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “making haste and hurrying”; \ver KJV\ver*, \ver ASV\ver* “being hastened and pressed.”\f* And the law was presented in Susa the citadel as well.
\p
\v 15 Now Mordecai went out from the king's presence in purple and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy. \f + \fr 8:15 \fn 15\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “shouted and rejoiced.” The expression is a hendiadys (see the note on \fx Es 5:10\fx* for an explanation of this figure).\f*
\v 16 For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor. \f + \fr 8:16 \fn 16\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “light and gladness and joy and honor” (so \ver NASB\ver*). The present translation understands the four terms to be a double hendiadys.\f*
\v 17 Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king's edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples \f + \fr 8:17 \fn 17\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “peoples of the land” (so \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NIV\ver* “people of other nationalities”; \ver NRSV\ver* “peoples of the country.”\f* pretended \f + \fr 8:17 \fn 18\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “were becoming Jews”; \ver NAB\ver* “embraced Judaism.” However, the Hitpael stem of the verb is sometimes used of a feigning action rather than a genuine one (see, e.g., \fx 2Sa 13:5\fx*, \fx 2Sa 13:6\fx*), which is the way the present translation understands the use of the word here (cf. \ver NEB\ver* “professed themselves Jews”; \ver NRSV\ver* “professed to be Jews”). This is the only occurrence of this verb in the Hebrew Bible, so there are no exact parallels. However, in the context of v. 17 the motivation of their conversion (\it Heb\it* “the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them”) should not be overlooked. The \ver LXX\ver* apparently understood the conversion described here to be genuine, since it adds the words “they were being circumcised and” before “they became Jews.”\f* to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them. \f + \fr 8:17 \fn 19\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \it Heb\it* “had fallen upon them” (so \ver NRSV\ver*); \ver NIV\ver* “had seized them.”\f*

\s The Jews Prevail over Their Enemies
\p 
\v 1 In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies. 
\v 2 The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples. 
\v 3 All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king's business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. 
\v 4 Mordecai was of high rank 
\f + \fr 9:4 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “great”; \ver NRSV\ver* “powerful”; \ver NIV\ver* “prominent”; \ver NCV\ver* “very important.”\f* in the king's palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence 
\f + \fr 9:4 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “the man Mordecai” (so \ver NASB\ver*, \ver NRSV\ver*).\f* continued to become greater and greater. 
\p 
\v 5 The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies. 
\v 6 In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
\v 7 In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
\v 8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
\v 9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
\v 10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property. 
\p 
\v 11 On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king's attention. 
\v 12 Then the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.” 
\p 
\v 13 Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today's law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows.” 
\p 
\v 14 So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. 
\v 15 The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property. 
\p 
\v 16 The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand 
\f + \fr 9:16 \fn 3\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft For this number much of the Greek \sc ms\sc* tradition reads “fifteen thousand.” The Lucianic Greek recension reads “70,100.”\f* of their adversaries, but they did not confiscate their property. 
\v 17 All of this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness. 
\s The Origins of the Feast of Purim
\p 
\v 18 But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness. 
\v 19 This is why the Jews who are in the rural country – those who live in rural cities – set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday for happiness, banqueting, holiday, and sending gifts to one another. 
\p 
\v 20 Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
\v 21 to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year 
\v 22 as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies – the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor. 
\p 
\v 23 So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them. 
\v 24 For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast \it pur\it*  (that is, the lot) in order to afflict and destroy them. 
\v 25 But when the matter came to the king's attention, the king 
\f + \fr 9:25 \fn 4\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “he”; the referent (the king) has been specified in the translation for clarity.\f* gave written orders that Haman's 
\f + \fr 9:25 \fn 5\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “his”; the referent (Haman) has been specified in the translation for clarity.\f* evil intentions that he had devised against the Jews should fall on his own head. He and his sons were hanged on the gallows. 
\v 26 For this reason these days are known as \it Purim\it*, after the name of \it pur\it*. 
\v 27 Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis. 
\v 28 These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants. 
\p 
\v 29 So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second 
\f + \fr 9:29 \fn 6\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The \ver LXX\ver* and the Syriac \ver Peshitta\ver* omit the word “second.”\f* letter about Purim. 
\v 30 Letters were sent 
\f + \fr 9:30 \fn 7\fn* \fl Textual Criticism\fl* \ft The present translation is based on the Niphal form \heb וַיּשָּׁלַח\heb* (\it vayyishalakh\it*, “were sent”; so also \ver NRSV\ver*, \ver TEV\ver*, \ver CEV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver*) rather than the reading of the \ver MT\ver* \heb וַיּשְׁלַח\heb* (\it vayyishlakh\it*, Qal, “and he sent”). The subject of the \ver MT\ver* verb would have to be Mordecai (cf. \ver NAB\ver*, \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NCV\ver*), but this is problematic in light of v. 29, where both Esther and Mordecai are responsible for the letters.\f* to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the empire of Ahasuerus – words of true peace 
\f + \fr 9:30 \fn 8\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “peace and truth.” The expression is probably a hendiadys (see the note on \fx Es 5:10\fx* for an explanation of this figure).\f* – 
\v 31 to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation. 
\v 32 Esther's command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded. 
\f + \fr 9:32 \fn 9\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “written in the book” (so \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NIV\ver*, \ver NLT\ver* “written down in the records”; \ver NRSV\ver* “recorded in writing.”\f*

\s Mordecai's Fame Increases
\p 
\v 1 King Ahasuerus then imposed forced labor on the land and on the coastlands of the sea. 
\v 2 Now all the actions carried out under his authority and his great achievements, along with an exact statement concerning the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king promoted, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia? 
\v 3 Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus. He was the highest-ranking 
\f + \fr 10:3 \fn 1\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “great among the Jews” (so \ver KJV\ver*, \ver NASB\ver*); \ver NIV\ver* “preeminent among the Jews”; \ver NRSV\ver* “powerful among the Jews.”\f* Jew, and he was admired by his numerous relatives. 
\f + \fr 10:3 \fn 2\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “brothers”; \ver NASB\ver* “kinsmen”; \ver NIV\ver* “fellow Jews.”\f* He worked enthusiastically 
\f + \fr 10:3 \fn 3\fn* \fl Translator's Note\fl* \ft \it Heb\it* “he was seeking”; \ver NAB\ver* “as the promoter of his people's welfare.”\f* for the good of his people and was an advocate for the welfare of

\f + \fr 10:3 \fn 5\fn* \fl Study Note \fl* \ft A number of additions to the Book of Esther appear in the apocryphal (or deuterocanonical) writings. These additions supply further information about various scenes described in the canonical book and are interesting in their own right. However, they were never a part of the Hebrew Bible. The placement of this additional material in certain Greek manuscripts of the Book of Esther may be described as follows. At the beginning of Esther there is an account (= chapter 11) of a dream in which Mordecai is warned by God of a coming danger for the Jews. In this account two great dragons, representing Mordecai and Haman, prepare for conflict. But God responds to the prayers of his people, and the crisis is resolved. This account is followed by another one (= chapter 12) in which Mordecai is rewarded for disclosing a plot against the king's life. After \fx Es 3:13\fx* there is a copy of a letter from King Artaxerxes authorizing annihilation of the Jews (= chapter 13). After \fx Es 4:17\fx* the account continues with a prayer of Mordecai (= part of chapter 13), followed by a prayer of Esther (= chapter 14), and an account which provides details about Esther's appeal to the king in behalf of her people (= chapter 15). After \fx Es 8:12\fx* there is a copy of a letter from King Artaxerxes in which he denounces Haman and his plot and authorizes his subjects to assist the Jews (= chapter 16). At the end of the book, following \fx Es 10:3\fx*, there is an addition which provides an interpretation to Mordecai's dream, followed by a brief ascription of genuineness to the entire book (= chapter 11).\f*
